These are the pre-signed urls, some of the members of our team could not access them. We are submitting these as they are
what eclipse gives us.

These are the links that consistently work. They are just some modifications off of the presigned URLs.

Organizer landing page: https://schedulerbucket2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/index.html#/createSchedule

Participant landing page: https://schedulerbucket2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/index.html#/searchSchedule

System Admin landing page: https://schedulerbucket2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/index.html#/sysAdminSearch

When an organizer creates a schedule, it generates a public url for them to distribute to their participants. We did not know if that link would count as the landing page or not for the participant, so we created a page for the participant where they could put in the secret code to get the schedule.


Additionally, if there is an issue with accessing the webpages, the following are the MD5 hashes for our S3 files.
If there is any issue, we have also saved a snapshot of our program (which can be verified by the hashes) so that you
can properly gauage our project by the submission timeline.
